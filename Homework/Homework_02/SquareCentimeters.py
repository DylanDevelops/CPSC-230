Create a program called “SquareCentimeters.py”
Say the user has a pet reptile. When they are going to buy a tank, they find that the size is typically given in liters. The user wants to calculate the footprint of a tank in square centimeters so that they are sure their pet will have enough space to comfortably move around. Assume the tank is a perfect cube (length, width, and height are the same) and write a program that calculates the area of the footprint of the tank in square centimeters.
1) Prompt the user for the volume of the tank in liters
2) Prompt the user for the species of reptile they plan to adopt.
3) Calculate the footprint of the tank in square centimeters (hint, you can use a function in the math module to calculate the cube root)
4) Display the area to the user
