    The game is a simple text-based combat game where you choose 
a character and fight against a computer. The game is played by 
selecting a character and then choosing a difficulty. The difficulty 
changes the stats of both the player and the computer.

    The game is played by choosing to either attack or dodge. If
you attack and the computer attacks, both of you take damage. If 
you attack and the computer dodges, the computer takes less damage. 
If you dodge and the computer attacks, you take less damage. If you 
both dodge, no one takes damage. 

    The game ends when the player or the computer's health is less 
than or equal to 0. The computer wins if the player's health is less 
than or equal to 0. If the computer's health is less than or equal to 
0, the player wins. It is a tie if the player and the computer's health 
is less than or equal to 0.

    After the game, the player is asked if they would like to play again. 
If they choose to play again, the game restarts. If they decide to exit, 
the game ends.
